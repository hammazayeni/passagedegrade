# Project Summary
The Taekwondo Sbeitla project is a web application designed to streamline the management of Taekwondo promotion tests. It allows instructors to efficiently handle student data, including managing current and upcoming belt tests. The application features a visually appealing projection mode for public displays, supports bilingual functionality (French and English), and utilizes local storage for data persistence. This makes it an ideal solution for real-time event management, enhancing the overall experience of Taekwondo events.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **Dashboard**: A management interface enabling instructors to add, edit, and evaluate students, featuring an updated layout and a CSV import functionality for bulk student registration.
- **Projection Mode**: A dedicated view displaying current candidate details for public viewing, enhanced with an infinite logo carousel and improved visual effects.
- **Student Management**: Tools for adding, editing, and deleting student profiles, along with status updates for test results.
